# Input Box Shrinking Animation

## Overview
The AI assistance input box now features a subtle, professional shrinking animation when the AI is processing a response. The animation provides clear visual feedback without being distracting or unprofessional.

## Features

### Professional Shrinking Animation
- **Subtle Scale Effect**: The input box shrinks to 95% of its original size when `isLoading` is true
- **Height Reduction**: Reduces padding from `py-2 sm:py-3 md:py-4 lg:py-5` to `py-1 sm:py-2 md:py-3 lg:py-4` during loading
- **Gentle Opacity Change**: Reduces opacity to 85% during loading for subtle visual feedback
- **Smooth Transitions**: All animations use 300ms duration with ease-in-out timing for faster response
- **Professional Border**: Maintains subtle gray borders instead of bright colors
- **Background Change**: Slightly darker background during loading to indicate processing

### Visual Effects
- **Subtle Scaling**: Container scales to 95% for visible but not excessive impact
- **Height Shrinking**: Input field becomes shorter during loading
- **Professional Design**: No excessive colors or glowing effects
- **Loading Placeholder**: Changes to "AI is processing..." during loading
- **Button State**: Send button becomes slightly transparent during loading
- **Responsive Design**: All elements scale proportionally across different screen sizes

## Implementation Details

### CSS Classes Added
```css
/* Main container scaling */
scale-95 opacity-85 (loading)
scale-100 opacity-100 (normal)

/* Container scaling */
scale-95 opacity-90 (loading)
scale-100 opacity-100 (normal)

/* Input field effects */
border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 (loading)
bg-gray-150 dark:bg-[#1a1a1a] (loading)
shadow-sm (loading)
py-1 sm:py-2 md:py-3 lg:py-4 (loading)
py-2 sm:py-3 md:py-4 lg:py-5 (normal)

/* Button effects */
bg-purple-600 opacity-75 (loading)
```

### Component Changes
1. **ChatInputField**: 
   - Added `isLoading` prop and conditional styling
   - Uses standard Tailwind scale classes (scale-95)
   - Height reduction during loading
   - Professional border colors
   - Loading placeholder text

2. **ChatInputActions**: 
   - Added scaling and opacity effects
   - Reduced button sizes for better proportion
   - Smaller icon sizes for compact design

3. **Main Container**: 
   - Added subtle scaling effect (95%)
   - Removed excessive border colors
   - Professional shadow effects

4. **Send Button**: 
   - Simple opacity change during loading
   - Removed excessive animations
   - Professional appearance

5. **File Preview**: 
   - More compact design
   - Smaller icons and text
   - Reduced spacing

## Usage
The animation automatically triggers when the `isLoading` prop is passed to the `ChatInput` component. The animation returns to normal when `isLoading` becomes false.

## Professional Design Principles
- **Subtle Effects**: Minimal visual changes that don't distract
- **Consistent Colors**: Maintains the existing color scheme
- **Fast Transitions**: 300ms duration for quick feedback
- **Accessible**: Clear visual indicators without being overwhelming
- **Responsive**: Works well across all screen sizes

## Responsive Design
- **Mobile**: Compact design with smaller buttons and text
- **Tablet**: Medium-sized elements with balanced proportions
- **Desktop**: Full-sized elements with optimal spacing
- **All screen sizes**: Consistent shrinking behavior

## Browser Compatibility
- Uses CSS transitions and transforms for smooth animations
- Compatible with all modern browsers
- Gracefully degrades on older browsers (no animation, but functionality remains)

## Performance
- Uses CSS transforms for hardware acceleration
- Minimal performance impact
- Smooth 60fps animations
